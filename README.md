### Idea 1
- Beer Recommender
- Data: [here](https://www.kaggle.com/nickhould/craft-cans) 
    - 5 features (too little?!) of 2,400 craft beers Kaggle link 
- **MVP:** Build website for others to be able to select a beer they like then be provided 3 - 5 recommendations

### Idea 2
- Humpback Whale Identification 
- Data: [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/humpback-whale-identification/data)
    - Challenge: Database of over 25,000 images and has over 5,000 individual Whales. Emailed company to see if I can obtain the type of Whales and would adjust the problem to work on classifying the top 10 Whales and the rest as other. Or I can select the most photographed Whale and build a model can correctly identify that Whale out of the whole dataset.
- **MVP:** Correctly identify a Whale based off an image of it's tail

### Idea 3
- Animal Faces
- Data: [here](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/animal-faces)
    - 16k+ images of Dog, Cat and Wildlife faces
- **MVP:** Correctly classify image as Dog, Cat, or Wildlife

## **ALSO!** 
I love this [Google Conceptual Captions Competition](https://ai.google.com/research/ConceptualCaptions) Could I even do this within a week? Ideas, thoughts? Here is a smaller set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hsankesara/flickr-image-dataset)
