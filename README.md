### Idea 1
- Beer Recommender
- Data: [here](https://www.kaggle.com/nickhould/craft-cans) 
    - 5 features (too little?!) of 2,400 craft beers Kaggle link 
- **MVP:** Build flask website for others to be able to select a beer they like then be provided 3 - 5 recommendations

### Idea 2
- Bringing it back to my Instacart Data
- Data: [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis)
    - Challenge: Continue to work on prediciting if a user will reorder, and also add on to this so I can recommend items (or even a full cart!) to a user. I'll be faced with the same sparse data set, will that be too big of a challenge for me to tackle in one week?
- **MVP:** Recommend items to specific users based on previous orders

### Idea 3
- Animal Faces
- Data: [here](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/animal-faces)
    - 16k+ images of Dog, Cat and Wildlife faces
- **MVP:** Correctly classify image as Dog, Cat, or Wildlife

## **ALSO!** 
I love this [Google Conceptual Captions Competition](https://ai.google.com/research/ConceptualCaptions) Could I even do this within a week? Ideas, thoughts? Here is a smaller set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hsankesara/flickr-image-dataset)
