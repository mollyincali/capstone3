- Dataset: [Animal Faces](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/animal-faces)
- 15k+ images of Dog, Cat and Wildlife faces
- **MVP:** Given an image of an animals face, can I create a model that will classify the animal?
- **MVP:** Do some unsupervised learning on the "Wildlife" images and see if I can classify those since they do not have labels

1) Examples data set and goal
2) Explain CNN classification model
3) Share results from CNN model
4) Where the model went wrong
5) Tested images with classmates animals
6) Autoencoder on wild folder
7) How autoencoder works, how I got middle layer
8) Show iterations of blurry images
9) Clusters of images
10) Next steps
