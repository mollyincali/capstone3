- Dataset: [Animal Faces](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/animal-faces)
- 16k+ images of Dog, Cat and Wildlife faces
- **MVP:** Given an image of an animals face, can I create a model that will classify the animal?
- **MVP:** Do some unsupervised learning on the "Wildlife" images and see if I can classify those since they do not have labels
